## üì° Project Overview

As the **embedded software engineer** on NYU's CubeSAT team, I developed the mission science payload system for a 1U CubeSAT designed to collect weather-related scientific data as part of **NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI)**.

This project involved designing and implementing a sophisticated multi-sensor platform using FreeRTOS on STM32 microcontrollers, with custom PCB design, real-time data acquisition, and space-grade reliability requirements.

### üöÄ Mission Stats
- **Duration**: 90-day orbital mission
- **Sensors**: 5 integrated sensors (GPS, Geiger Counter, Humidity/Temperature, Pressure, IMU)
- **Hardware**: 2 custom PCB modules designed in Altium
- **Performance**: Real-time performance with sub-millisecond response requirements
- **Team Size**: 5 interdisciplinary engineers

Implemented sophisticated RTOS synchronization using FreeRTOS:

```c
// GPS processing with interrupt-driven UART handling
void GPS_ProcessThread(void *pvParameters) {
    while(1) {
        // Block until UART interrupt unblocks this thread
        xSemaphoreTake(uartSemaphore, portMAX_DELAY);
        ProcessGPSData();
        // Yield to highest priority ready thread
        taskYIELD();
    }
}
```
